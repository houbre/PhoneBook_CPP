# PhoneBook_CPP
Converted my past phone book project in c++


$ g++ main.cpp phone.cpp phone_record.hpp


$ ./a.out


if a csv file exists and contains records, load those records into the struct phonebook


(1) -> add a record to the phonebook

(2) -> find a record in the phonebook (by name)

(3) -> list all the records in the phonebook

(4) -> exit the phonebook program (saves the current record in a csv file)
